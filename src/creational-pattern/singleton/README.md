What is it?

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance while providing a global access point to this instance from anywhere in the code. It is used in scenarios where only a single instance of a class is required to control the action throughout the execution.


When to use it?

    The Singleton pattern should be used when:

        You need to ensure that a class has only one instance, and you want to provide a single global point of access to it.

        You need to control a single resource from multiple places in your code, for example, a database connection, network socket, logging class, etc.

        You want to avoid multiple instances of a class, which could result in inconsistencies or unexpected behavior.

        You want to reduce the number of instances created for performance reasons, for example, for classes that are expensive to create.


How to implement it?

Here's how you can implement the Singleton pattern in Java:

    Declare the constructor as private to prevent other classes from instantiating it directly.

    Declare a private static instance variable to hold the single instance of the class.

    Define a public static method that returns the instance of the class. The first time the method is called, it creates a new instance of the class and stores it in the instance variable. Subsequent calls to the method return the stored instance.


Use case:

    Here are some common examples of using the Singleton pattern in Java:

        Database Connection Manager: A class that manages database connections, where only one instance of the class is required to manage all database connections throughout the application.

        Logging Service: A class that logs messages, where only one instance of the class is required to write logs to a file or database.

        Cache Manager: A class that caches frequently used data, where only one instance of the class is required to manage all cache operations throughout the application.

        Configuration Manager: A class that holds the application configuration, where only one instance of the class is required to provide a single source of truth for configuration information.

        Thread Pool Manager: A class that manages a pool of threads, where only one instance of the class is required to control the execution of all tasks in the thread pool.
