Creational patterns deal with the process of object creation

There are several creational design patterns, including the Singleton Pattern, the Factory Method Pattern, 
the Abstract Factory Pattern, the Builder Pattern, the Prototype Pattern. 
Each pattern provides a different solution to the problem of object creation, 
and they can be used in different contexts to improve the flexibility and maintainability of a software system.
