The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows an object to create a copy of itself without knowing its exact class. This pattern is particularly useful when the cost of creating a new instance of a class is more expensive than copying an existing instance. It is also useful when instances of the class can have one of a few different combinations of state.
Key Components:

    Prototype: Declares an interface for cloning itself.
    ConcretePrototype: Implements the operation for cloning itself.
    Client: Creates a new object by asking a prototype to clone itsel
