What is it?
The Factory Method Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

In the Factory Method pattern, a factory method is defined in the superclass, and is used to create objects. Subclasses can then override the factory method to return objects of a different type. The client code can work with objects through their abstract interfaces, without being concerned with the concrete classes that are instantiated.

The Factory Method Pattern provides a way to encapsulate object creation in a separate class, and allows the client code to work with objects through their abstract interfaces, without being concerned with the concrete classes that are instantiated. This can be useful in situations where you need to create objects that belong to a specific family or set, and you want to encapsulate the creation of these objects in a separate class.

For example, consider a system that creates documents, such as text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. The Factory Method Pattern can be used to create documents of different types, such as text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, without specifying the concrete classes that are instantiated. The client code can work with documents through their abstract interfaces, without being concerned with the concrete classes that are instantiated for a particular type of document.

When to use it?
Here are some common use cases for the Factory Method Design Pattern:

    Creating objects based on a set of inputs: The Factory Method Pattern can be used to create objects based on a set of inputs, such as the type of object that is being created, the data that is being passed in, or the configuration of the system.

    Encapsulating object creation: The Factory Method Pattern can be used to encapsulate object creation in a separate class, and allows the client code to work with objects through their abstract interfaces, without being concerned with the concrete classes that are instantiated.

    Implementing a family of related objects: The Factory Method Pattern can be used to implement a family of related objects, such as documents, that have a common theme or set of responsibilities.

    Providing a way to switch between object families at runtime: The Factory Method Pattern can be used to provide a way to switch between object families at runtime, so that the client code can work with different sets of objects, depending on the requirements of the application.

    Delegating the creation of objects to subclasses: The Factory Method Pattern can be used to delegate the creation of objects to subclasses, so that subclasses can return objects of a different type than the type that is returned by the superclass.

    Creating objects with specific configurations: The Factory Method Pattern can be used to create objects with specific configurations, such as objects that have specific data or objects that have specific behaviors, based on the inputs that are provided to the factory method.
