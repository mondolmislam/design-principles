You are working on a vehicle rental system where a customer can rent a car,a bike or a scooter.
Each type of vehicle has different properties, such as capacity, fuel efficiency, and rental cost. 
You can need to implement a VehicleFactory that creates objects of the different types of vehicles
based on the customer's selection.

How would you implement the VehicleFactory class to create object of different types of vehicles
using the factory method design pattern?
