What is it?

    The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a flexible and efficient way to create objects with complex constructors. The pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing you to build objects step by step.

When to use it?

You should use the Builder pattern when you need to build complex objects with multiple fields and/or optional fields. The pattern provides a flexible and readable way to construct objects, making it a good choice when:

    The class has a large number of constructor parameters: The Builder pattern allows you to create objects step by step, rather than having to pass all parameters to the constructor at once.

    Some of the parameters are optional: The Builder pattern provides a fluent API that allows you to specify only the parameters you need, making it easier to use.

    You want to enforce immutability: By making the fields final, you can ensure that the object cannot be modified once it is created.

    You want to make the code more readable and maintainable: The Builder pattern provides a readable, fluent API that makes the code more understandable and easier to maintain.

    You want to avoid Telescoping Constructor Anti-pattern: The Builder pattern allows you to avoid having a large number of constructors with varying numbers of parameters, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain.

How to implement it?

To create a Builder pattern in Java, you need to follow these steps:

    Create the object you want to build: The first step is to create the object you want to build, with its fields and getters.

    Create a Builder class: The next step is to create a separate Builder class with the same fields as the object you want to build.

    Add methods to set each field: The Builder class should have methods to set each field, such as age(int age), phone(String phone), and so on.

    Add a build method: The Builder class should have a build() method that returns the final object.

    Add a constructor: The object you want to build should have a constructor that takes the Builder as a parameter and uses it to set the fields.

Use the Builder: Finally, you can use the Builder to create objects by calling the methods to set each field and then calling the build() method to get the final object.
