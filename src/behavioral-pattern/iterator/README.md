The Iterator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying implementation. It separates the logic for accessing the elements of a collection from the implementation of the collection itself.

The main components of the Iterator Pattern are:

    Iterator: Defines the interface for iterating over the elements of a collection.

    Concrete Iterator: Implements the Iterator interface and keeps track of the current position in the collection.

    Aggregate: Defines the interface for creating an Iterator object.

    Concrete Aggregate: Implements the Aggregate interface and creates a Concrete Iterator object.

Here's how the Iterator Pattern works:

    The Client creates an Aggregate object.

    The Aggregate object creates a Concrete Iterator object and returns it to the Client.

    The Client calls the hasNext() method on the Iterator object to check if there are any more elements in the collection.

    The Client calls the next() method on the Iterator object to retrieve the next element in the collection.

    This process is repeated until all elements in the collection have been traversed.

The Iterator Pattern provides a way to access the elements of a collection without exposing its internal structure. This allows the collection to be modified without affecting the code that uses the Iterator. It also provides a way to iterate over a collection in a uniform manner, regardless of the specific type of the collection. Overall, the Iterator Pattern makes it easy to add new types of collections to an application, as long as they implement the Aggregate interface and return a Concrete Iterator object.
