Suppose you are building an online ordering system for a restaurant, and you want to implement a system that processes each 
order based on type of food ordered. You want to implement a system where each type of food is handled by a separate handler,
and if one handler cannot handle the order, it passes the request to the next handler until it is successfully processed.
How would you implement this in java?
