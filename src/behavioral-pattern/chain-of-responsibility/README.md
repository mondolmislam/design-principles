The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object in a chain to handle a specific request or task. Instead of a single object processing a request, multiple objects are involved, and each one has the opportunity to process the request. The objects are organized into a chain, and the request is passed down the chain until it is handled by the appropriate object.

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is useful in situations where you have a series of processing steps, and you're not sure which object is responsible for each step. Instead of hard-coding the processing steps into a single object, the steps can be broken up into smaller, more specialized objects that are easier to manage and maintain.

Here's how the Chain of Responsibility pattern works:

    A request is made to the first object in the chain.

    If the object can handle the request, it does so and returns a response.

    If the object can't handle the request, it passes the request down the chain to the next object.

    This process is repeated until the request is handled or the end of the chain is reached.

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is often used in event-driven systems, where a request may trigger a series of events that need to be processed in a specific order. It can also be used to implement error handling or exception handling in a system.

Here's an example of how you can implement the Chain of Responsibility design pattern in Java:
Step-by-Step Implementation:

    1. Create an abstract handler class.
    2. Create concrete handler classes that extend the abstract handler.
    3. Create a client that configures the chain and sends requests.
