The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact with each other. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly and allows for the interaction between the objects to vary independently of each other.

The main components of the Mediator Pattern are:

    Mediator: Defines the interface for communicating with Colleague objects.

    Concrete Mediator: Implements the Mediator interface and coordinates communication between Colleague objects.

    Colleague: Defines the interface for interacting with other Colleague objects through the Mediator.

    Concrete Colleague: Implements the Colleague interface and communicates with other Colleague objects through the Mediator.

Here's how the Mediator Pattern works:

    The Client creates a Concrete Mediator object and one or more Concrete Colleague objects.

    The Concrete Colleague objects register with the Concrete Mediator object.

    The Concrete Colleague objects send messages to other Colleague objects through the Concrete Mediator object.

    The Concrete Mediator object receives messages from Concrete Colleague objects and relays them to the appropriate Colleague object.

The Mediator Pattern promotes loose coupling by encapsulating the interactions between objects in a separate Mediator object. This allows for more flexibility in how the objects interact with each other and makes it easier to add new objects to the system. It also makes it easier to modify the interaction between objects without affecting the objects themselves, which can be useful when working with large, complex systems. Overall, the Mediator Pattern is a useful tool for managing interactions between objects in a flexible and extensible way.
