Suppose you are working on a large software project which involves multiple subsystems. 
One of the subsystems is responsible for managing user authentication, another for managing user 
profiles, and a third for managing user preference. As the project grows, the number of 
interfaces between these subsystems is becoming difficult to manage. How are you 
simplify the interactions between these subsystems while keeping their complexity
hidden from the rest of the system.
